/**
 * END-TO-END hook enforcement across the background process boundary.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * v1.9.0 shipped a fix for a CRITICAL self-inflicted regression: `startBackgroundJob`
 * spawned its worker with `process.execPath` (the fully symlink-resolved,
 * version-stamped `…/Cellar/node/<ver>/bin/node`) while `/kimi:setup` pins the
 * stable symlink (`/opt/homebrew/bin/node`). The spawned worker re-verifies the
 * PreToolUse hook by rebuilding the canonical command from ITS OWN `process.argv0`,
 * so it computed a different expected command than the config held → byte-exact
 * mismatch → every background rescue/ask refused FOREVER, and `/kimi:setup` could
 * not converge the two sides.
 *
 * That regression was caught by a pre-release model review, not by CI. The
 * post-release review identified the structural reason: every background test in
 * this suite sets `KIMI_PLUGIN_CC_SKIP_HOOK_CHECK=1`, and the one worker-refusal
 * test drives `executeAskJob` IN-PROCESS. Nothing ever ran a real detached worker
 * with enforcement on, so nothing could observe the two processes disagreeing.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT LIVE IN ask-background.test.ts
 *
 * The bug only manifests on the NO-OVERRIDE path: with `KIMI_PLUGIN_CC_NODE_BIN`
 * set, both the spawner and the verifier honor it verbatim and agree by
 * construction — the buggy code (`env.KIMI_PLUGIN_CC_NODE_BIN || process.execPath`)
 * did too. Reproducing it therefore requires the PARENT to be a real node process
 * invoked through a symlink, which is impossible inside `bun test` (there,
 * `process.execPath` is bun). So this test shells out: it runs the companion CLI
 * itself as a node subprocess, with no node-bin override, and lets the real
 * spawn→verify handshake happen.
